## 📍 Overview

The ChatGPT App is a React Native mobile application that allows users to have interactive conversations with an AI language model powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 technology. The app provides a user-friendly interface for sending messages and receiving AI-generated responses. The core functionalities include managing chat messages, navigating between screens, and handling API requests to fetch or send messages. The purpose of the project is to provide a seamless and engaging user experience for interacting with the AI model, enhancing communication capabilities, and showcasing the potential of conversational AI. Overall, the app offers a convenient and novel way for users to access and leverage AI-generated responses in real-time conversations.

## ⚙️ Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **⚙️ Architecture**    | The codebase follows a modular architecture, separating different functionalities into components and screens. It uses a stack navigation pattern for screen transition. The server-side is implemented using an Express.js server, which handles API requests and communicates with OpenAI's API for generating responses. The client-side is built with React Native and TypeScript, ensuring type safety and scalability. Overall, the architecture allows for easy extensibility and maintainability. |
| **📖 Documentation**   | The codebase lacks comprehensive documentation. While some files have summary comments, the overall documentation is limited. Additional comments and inline explanations could improve the understanding of the codebase for future developers. |
| **🔗 Dependencies**    | The codebase relies on various external libraries such as React, React Native, react-navigation, and axios for client-side development. On the server-side, it utilizes Express.js and dotenv for handling API requests and managing environment variables. The integration with OpenAI's API is significant for generating responses. The codebase includes a package.json file that lists all the dependencies. |
| **🧩 Modularity**      | The codebase demonstrates good modularity by organizing functionality into components and screens. Each component focuses on a specific task, promoting reusability and maintainability. The use of a DataProvider context ensures centralized state management, enhancing the separation of concerns. However, there are opportunities to further modularize specific code sections for improved code clarity and organization. |
| **✔️ Testing**         | There is no explicit testing framework or tests provided in the codebase. Incorporating unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests would enhance the codebase's reliability, correctness, and maintainability. Adding a testing framework like Jest or React Native Testing Library would be beneficial for thorough testing coverage. |
| **⚡️ Performance**     | The codebase appears to handle performance reasonably well. However, without specific performance metrics or details, it is challenging to provide a comprehensive evaluation. To optimize performance further, considerations like code profiling, performance monitoring tools, and caching mechanisms could be implemented. |
| **🔐 Security**        | The codebase does not explicitly address security measures other than fetching messages from an API using POST requests. Depending on the API's implementation, additional security measures may be required, such as input sanitization and data validation for user-generated content, rate limiting to prevent abuse, and secure communication protocols like HTTPS. |
| **🔀 Version Control** | The codebase utilizes Git for version control as shown by the presence of a GitHub repository. However, no explicit version control strategies or tools are mentioned in the repository itself. It would be beneficial to include a clear version control strategy, branching model, and commit guidelines in the project documentation or a version control guide. |
| **🔌 Integrations**    | The codebase
